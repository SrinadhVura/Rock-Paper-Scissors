üéÆ **Interactive Rock Paper Scissors Game using Computer Vision (OpenCV) and MediaPipe Hands Framework**

This repository hosts a Python-based project that brings the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors to life interactively using Computer Vision techniques with OpenCV and the precise hand tracking capabilities of the MediaPipe Hands framework.

**Project Overview:**
The application seamlessly combines the power of Computer Vision technologies, OpenCV, and MediaPipe Hands framework to create an engaging Rock Paper Scissors game. Users can play the game by showcasing their hand gestures in front of the webcam, allowing the application to detect and respond accordingly.

**Key Features:**


1Ô∏è‚É£ **Hand Detection using MediaPipe**: Utilizes the MediaPipe Hands framework to accurately identify and track hand gestures in real-time.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Real-time Webcam Interaction**: Captures and processes the user's hand movements through the webcam, enabling an interactive and immersive gaming experience.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Rock Paper Scissors Logic**: Implements the traditional rules of Rock Paper Scissors, allowing users to make their selection by displaying the corresponding hand sign to play against the computer.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Interactive Gameplay**: Matches the user's hand gesture against the computer's random choice, resulting in an engaging and interactive gaming session.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with an intuitive interface to ensure a seamless and enjoyable gaming experience.

üåü This repository demonstrates the potential of Computer Vision technologies in enhancing traditional games, offering an interactive and enjoyable way to play Rock Paper Scissors.
